## Project Overview
**BingeBox** is a personal entertainment library web app that lets users store, organize, and track their favorite movies, web series, and anime. Users can add content, maintain personalized watchlists, and track their progress. Movie and series details are fetched from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), while all user data is stored locally in the browser, so no backend or login is required.
